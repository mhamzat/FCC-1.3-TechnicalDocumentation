				<p>
					JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
					is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
					example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
					its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Section 2 -->
			<section id="what_you_should_already_know" class="main-section">
				<header>What you should already know</header>
				<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
						(HTTP, HTML, URLs, ...).
					</li>
					<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
					<li>
						Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
						of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<!-- Section 3 -->
			<section id="javascript_and_java" class="main-section">
				<header>JavaScript and Java</header>
				<p>
					JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
					different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
					does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
					JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
					basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
					from LiveScript to JavaScript.
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Section 4 -->
			<section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
				<header>Hello World</header>
				<p>
					To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
					your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
				</p>
				<pre><code>function greetMe(yourName) {
						alert("Hello " + yourName);
					}
					greetMe("World");
				</code></pre>
				<p>
					Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
					browser!
				</p>

			<!-- Section 5 -->
			<section id="variables" class="main-section">
				<header>Variables</header>
				<p>
					You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
					The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
					dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
					Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
					"A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
					(lowercase).
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
					identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
					characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
					Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight">Note:</span> You can't use a reserved word as
					an identifier. For a list of reserved words, see Reserved words.
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Section 6 -->
			<section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
				<header>Declaring variables</header>
				<p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						With the keyword <code>var</code>. For example,
						<code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to declare both
						local and global variables.
					</li>
					<li>
						By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code>
						This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
						JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
					</li>
					<li>
						With the keyword <code>let</code>. For example,
						<code>let y = 13.</code> This syntax can be used to declare a
						block-scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
					</li>
				</ul>
